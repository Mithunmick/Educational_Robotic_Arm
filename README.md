Fall 2024

Designed and simulated a 4-DOF robotic arm with direct and inverse kinematics, Jacobian-based control, and trajectory planning.

Computed dynamic model using inertia matrix, Coriolis forces, and gravitational torque for real-time torque estimation.

Developed vision-based object detection using OpenCV to localize red Smarties and control the robot to interact with them.

Integrated computer vision into a state-machine workflow, enabling the robot to autonomously detect and poke targets.

Tools & Technologies: MATLAB, Python, OpenCV, Robotics Toolbox, HSV color space filtering.
